My name is Romain Péchayre I am a senior software engineer based in Paris currently working as CTO at [Applidget](http://applidget.com), a company I joined as co-founder in 2010. We build online platforms for event organizers and also work for other startups to help them define and develop their products.

Prior to Applidget, I was working for Air France as an operations research analyst. 

I attended  [Ecole Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.edu/) in France from 2004 to 2007 and then graduated from the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx) in 2008.

When I am not at work, I love spending time with my family. I also like drumming, kiteboarding, skiing and taking photos.
