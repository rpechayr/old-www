I am Romain Péchayre I am a software engineer and I am co-founder and CTO at [Yeeld](https://www.yeeld.com). We make a micro-saving app using automatic saving rules inspired by behavioral economics. Before that I co-founded [Eventmaker](https://www.eventmaker.io).

I attended the [Ecole Polytechnique](http://www.polytechnique.edu/) in France from 2004 to 2007 and then graduated from the [London School of Economics and Political Science](http://www.lse.ac.uk/home.aspx) in 2008.
